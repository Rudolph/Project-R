RChassis
=========

Chassis code for Ruprecht the Rudforce Research Robot
http://hackaday.io/project/1615-Project-R

Uses mighty1284p to put arduino stuff on an ATmega1284p
	https://github.com/JChristensen/mighty-1284p

Requires Paul Stoffregen's MsTimer2 library
	https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/MsTimer2
(my version tweaked to work on the 1284)
	https://github.com/Rudolph/MsTimer2

License is yet to be determined, but it'll definitely be open source.
I'm leaning toward MIT I think, unless someone else's library or
something forces the GPL on me.

Learn markdown...
