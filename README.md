Project-R
=========

Project R did not move on to the final round of The Hackaday Prize 2014. Shortly
thereafter development ground to a complete halt, partly due to losing, partly
due to moving. In the months that followed I realized that I was building R for
the wrong reasons anyway. Now that the move and those pesky holidays are in the
rearview I think I'll get back to R development. But this time I'll design and
build things for myself, not for what I (likely mistakenly) think someone would
want to see for a contest entry (imagine that). And, since I won't have any kind
of time crunch, I intend on tearing down what I've got so far and starting over.
This time I'll build in stages, and make certain each stage functions as intended
before moving on to the next, instead of just bolting layer after layer on top
and sorting it all out at the end (which never comes).

Stay tuned. Or don't. I don't really care :P

License is yet to be determined, but it'll definitely be open source. I'm
leaning toward MIT I think, unless some other library or something forces
the GPL on me.
